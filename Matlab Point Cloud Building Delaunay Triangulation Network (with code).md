   The function of MATLAB to build Delaunay triangulation is: delaunayTriangulation, the three-dimensional point that this function needs to enter is double type, and the default storage format of point cloud in pcd format is float, so float needs to be converted to doiuble type. For detailed usage of delaunayTriangulation function, just enter: help delaunayTriangulation in the matlab command line window to view. Since matlab is a non-open source software, the algorithm is only used for simulation experiments and does not go into depth.
