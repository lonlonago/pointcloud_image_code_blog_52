#  First, the principle of the algorithm 

##  1. Preface 

   The on-board mobile measurement system can quickly, dynamically and efficiently obtain the three-dimensional point cloud of the road surface and the ground objects on both sides. However, during the vehicle driving process, the obtained point cloud has a certain slope compared with the real scene due to the deceleration belt, road surface damage, unevenness, and bumps. The tripod of the ground 3D laser scanner sinks due to factors such as loose soil at the position of the station, which leads to the deviation of the obtained point cloud from the real scene in the horizontal plane direction, which is not conducive to the high-precision fusion of multi-station data based on four parameters in the later stage. Therefore, horizontal calibration is required.
