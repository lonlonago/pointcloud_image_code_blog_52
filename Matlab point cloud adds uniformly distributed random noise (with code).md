##  I. Overview of algorithms 

##  1. Evenly distributed 

   In probability theory and statistics, a uniform distribution, also known as a rectangular distribution, is a symmetric probability distribution in which the probability of a distribution at the same length interval is equally likely. The uniform distribution is defined by two parameters, a and b, which are the minimum and maximum values on the number line, usually abbreviated as.

  ```  
   Returns a sz1 ×... × szN array of random numbers, where sz1,..., szN indicates the size of each dimension. For example: rand (3,4) returns a 3 × 4 matrix. In general, N random numbers within the interval (a, b) can be generated using the formula r = a + (b-a). * rand (N, 1).
