#  First, the principle of the algorithm 

##  1. OBB bounding box 

   OBB (Oriented Bounding Box) is essentially a cuboid that is closest to the object, but the cuboid can be rotated arbitrarily according to the first moment of the object. OBB bounding boxes and AABBs are closer to the object and can significantly reduce the number of enclosures.

   The rigid3d function is a new function in matlab 2020a and above, so why do some bosses make mistakes?? Why ask??????
