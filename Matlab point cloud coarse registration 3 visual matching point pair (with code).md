  ```  
   Displays the point clouds ptCloud 1 and ptCloud 2 and their matching feature points, matching PtCloud 1 and matedPtCloud 2. The colors of the graph are encoded by the point clouds, and each point cloud is connected to a corresponding point in the other point cloud by a line. Overload Function 2:

>  The matching features and point clouds are color-coded to enhance the visualization: Magenta - the source point cloud. Green - the target point cloud. Red circle - the matching point in the source point cloud. Blue asterisk - the matching point in the target point cloud. Yellow - the connection between the matching point pairs.
